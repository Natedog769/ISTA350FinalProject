This data set features a lot of data about the prices of home around the US and grouped by states. I find this data set interesting it can help show where 
the most expensive and cheapest houses are in the US and I think this data can be correlated with other data such as cost of living, or minimum wages.
These are important data sets that can or will impact all of us in someway or another and of course there is a lot of rhetoric that higher minimum wages cases inflation
and housing prices are usually directly affected by inflation.
